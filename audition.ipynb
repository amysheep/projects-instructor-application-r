In this project, we will examine a real-life  Simpson's paradox example from a medical study comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones. We will identify the 'lurking' variable that causes the confusion and using multiple logistic regression to solve the puzzle!\n",

    "In the year of 1986, a group of urologists in London published a research paper in the British Medical Journal to compare two different methods in their effectiveness of removing kidney stones. Treatment A is open surgery (invasive) and treatment B is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (less invasive). When they looked at the results from the total of 700 patients, treatment B had a higher success rate. However, when they only look at the sub grouped data for patients with small kidney stones or large kidney stones, treatment A had better outcomes. What is going on here? In this notebook, we are going to solve the puzzle by using multiple regression and other statistical tools. Let's dive in now!\n",
